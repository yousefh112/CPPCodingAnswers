# Problem: Coordinates of a Point

## Description

Given two numbers `X` and `Y`, which represent the coordinates of a point in a 2D plane, determine in which quarter or axis the point belongs.

### Output:

- If the point is at the origin, print "Origem".
- If the point is on the X-axis, print "Eixo X".
- If the point is on the Y-axis, print "Eixo Y".
- If the point is in the first quarter, print "Q1".
- If the point is in the second quarter, print "Q2".
- If the point is in the third quarter, print "Q3".
- If the point is in the fourth quarter, print "Q4".

## Input:

Only one line containing two numbers `X` and `Y` (-1000 ≤ X, Y ≤ 1000).

## Examples:

### Example 1:

#### Input

```
4.5 -2.2
```

#### Output

```
Q4
```

### Example 2:

#### Input

```
0.1 0.1
```

#### Output

```
Q1
```
