## Problem Description

Given a number `X`, determine in which of the following intervals the number `X` belongs to:

- [0,25]
- (25,50]
- (50,75]

**Note:**
- If `X` belongs to any of the above intervals, print "Interval " followed by the interval.
- If `X` does not belong to any of the above intervals, print "Out of Intervals".

The symbols `(` represent greater than, `)` represent smaller than, `[` represent greater than or equal, and `]` represent smaller than or equal.

## Input
