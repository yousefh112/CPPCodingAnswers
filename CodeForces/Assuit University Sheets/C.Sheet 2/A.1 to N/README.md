## Problem: Print Numbers from 1 to N

### Problem Statement
Given a number N, print numbers from 1 to N in separate lines.

### Input
Only one line containing a number N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10^3).

### Output
Print N lines, each containing a number from 1 to N, in ascending order.

### Example
#### Input
```
5
```
#### Output
```
1
2
3
4
5
```

### Explanation
For the given example, the program prints numbers from 1 to 5 in separate lines as requested.

## Implementation Details
The solution to this problem is a simple program that takes an integer input N and outputs numbers from 1 to N in separate lines. The code should use a loop to iterate from 1 to N and print each number on a new line.

### Input Handling
The program should read a single integer N from the standard input. Ensure that N is within the valid range (1 ≤ N ≤ 10^3).

### Output
Print N lines, each containing a single number from 1 to N. Use the standard output for the output.

### Sample Input/Output
For the provided example, the program should output the following:
```
1
2
3
4
5
```
## Run Instructions
1. Input the value of N.
2. Run the program.
3. The program will print numbers from 1 to N in separate lines.
