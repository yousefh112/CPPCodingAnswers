## Problem: Even Numbers

### Problem Statement
Given a number N, print all even numbers between 1 and N (inclusive) in separate lines. If there are no even numbers, print -1.

### Input
Only one line containing a number N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10^3).

### Output
Print even numbers from 1 to N in separate lines. If there are no even numbers, print -1.

### Example
#### Input
```
10
```
#### Output
```
2
4
6
8
10
```

#### Input
```
5
```
#### Output
```
2
4
```

### Explanation
For the first example, the program prints even numbers from 1 to 10 (inclusive): 2, 4, 6, 8, 10.

For the second example, the program prints even numbers from 1 to 5 (inclusive): 2, 4.

If there are no even numbers, the program prints -1.

## Implementation Details
The solution to this problem involves iterating through numbers from 1 to N and printing even numbers in separate lines. The program should handle cases where there are no even numbers by printing -1.

### Input Handling
The program should read a single integer N from the standard input. Ensure that N is within the valid range (1 ≤ N ≤ 10^3).

### Output
Print even numbers from 1 to N in separate lines. If there are no even numbers, print -1. Use the standard output for the output.

### Run Instructions
1. Input the value of N.
2. Run the program.
3. The program will print even numbers from 1 to N in separate lines or -1 if there are no even numbers.
