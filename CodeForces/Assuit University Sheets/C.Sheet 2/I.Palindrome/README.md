# Palindrome Checker

## Problem Description
Given a number \( N \), this program prints two lines that contain the following:
1. \( N \) printed in reversed order, excluding leading zeroes.
2. If \( N \) is a palindrome number, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Definition:
- A palindrome number is a number that reads the same forward or backward.
  For example, 12321, 101 are palindrome numbers, while 1201, 221 are not.

- A leading zero is any 0 digit that comes before the first nonzero digit in a number.
  For example, numbers like 005, 01, 0123, 02, 000250 are considered to have leading zeroes, while numbers like 5, 123, 20, 2500 are not considered to have leading zeroes.

## Input
- Only one line containing a number \( N \) (where \( 1 \leq N \leq 10^7 \)).

## Output
- Print the answer required above.

### Examples
#### Input
```
12121
```
#### Output
```
12121
YES
```
#### Input
```
160
```
#### Output
