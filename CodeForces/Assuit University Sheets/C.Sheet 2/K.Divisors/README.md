## K. Divisors

### Problem Description
Given a number N, this program prints all the positive divisors of N in ascending order.

### Input
The input consists of only one line containing a number N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10^4).

### Output
The program prints all positive divisors of N, one number per line.

### Example
**Input:**
```
6
```
**Output:**
```
1
2
3
6
```
**Input:**
```
7
```
**Output:**
```
1
7
```
**Input:**
```
4
```
**Output:**
```
1
2
4
```

### Note
A divisor of a number is a number that divides the integer exactly (with no remainder). In other words, the division works perfectly with no fractions or remainders involved. A divisor is also a factor of the original integer. For example:
- 3 is a divisor of 12 because 12 ÷ 3 = 4 exactly.
- 4 is a divisor of 12 because 12 ÷ 4 = 3 exactly.
- 5 is not a divisor of 12 because 12 ÷ 5 = 2 with a remainder of 2.
