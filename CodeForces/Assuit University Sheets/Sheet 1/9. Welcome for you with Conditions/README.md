# Problem: Welcome for you with Conditions

Welcome to the "Welcome for you with Conditions" problem! This simple program checks if one number is greater than or equal to another and prints "Yes" or "No" accordingly.

## Input
- Two non-negative integers, A and B, separated by a space. (0 ≤ A, B ≤ 100)

## Output
- Print "Yes" if A is greater than or equal to B, otherwise print "No".

## Examples
### Input
```
10 9
```
### Output
```
Yes
```
### Input
```
5 5
```
### Output
```
Yes
```
### Input
```
5 7
```
### Output
```
No
```

## Explanation
- In the first example, A is 10 and B is 9, so "Yes" is printed.
- In the second example, A is 5 and B is 5, so "Yes" is printed.
- In the third example, A is 5 and B is 7, so "No" is printed.

Feel free to explore different values of A and B to see how the program responds. Enjoy coding!
