# Max and Min

## Problem Description
Given three numbers A, B, and C, the program calculates and prints the minimum and maximum numbers among them.

## Input
The input consists of a single line containing three numbers A, B, and C ( - 10^5 ≤ A, B, C ≤ 10^5).

## Output
Print the minimum number followed by a single space and then print the maximum number.

## Example
### Input
```
1 2 3
```
### Output
```
1 3
```

### Input
```
-1 -2 -3
```
### Output
```
-3 -1
```

### Input
```
10 20 -5
```
### Output
```
-5 20
```

## Implementation Details
The program uses the `min` and `max` functions from the `<algorithm>` header to find the minimum and maximum values among the input numbers. The result is then printed.
