# Problem N: Char

## Overview

The program takes a single character as input and determines whether it is a lowercase or uppercase letter. It then converts the letter to its counterpart (lowercase to uppercase or vice versa) and outputs the result.

## Input

- Only one line containing a character `X` which will be a capital or small letter.

## Output

- Print the answer to this problem.

## Examples

### Example 1

#### Input

```
a
```

#### Output

```
A
```

### Example 2

#### Input

```
A
```

#### Output

```
a
```

## Implementation Details

- The program checks whether the input letter is uppercase or lowercase by comparing its ASCII value.
- It then performs the conversion by adjusting the ASCII value (adding or subtracting 32).
- The result is printed to the standard output.
