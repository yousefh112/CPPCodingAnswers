# The Last 2 Digits

## Problem Description
Given four numbers A, B, C, and D, calculate their product and print the last 2 digits of the result.

## Input
- Only one line containing four numbers A, B, C, and D (2 ≤ A, B, C, D ≤ 10^9).

## Output
- Print the last 2 digits from the product of the four numbers.

## Examples
### Example 1
#### Input
```
5 7 2 4
```
#### Output
```
80
```
#### Explanation
The multiplication of 4 numbers is \(5 \times 7 \times 2 \times 4 = 280\), so the answer is the last 2 digits, which are 80.

### Example 2
#### Input
```
3 9 9 9
```
#### Output
```
87
```
#### Explanation
The multiplication of 4 numbers is \(3 \times 9 \times 9 \times 9 = 2187\), so the answer is the last 2 digits, which are 87.
