# Selection Sort Implementation

This C++ program demonstrates the implementation of the Selection Sort algorithm. Selection Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and swaps it with the first element.

## How to Use:

1. Open the C++ file (`selection_sort.cpp`) in a C++ compiler or integrated development environment (IDE).

2. Compile and run the program.

3. The program initializes an array with random integers, displays the array before sorting, performs Selection Sort, and then displays the sorted array.

## Code Structure:

- `SelectionSort` function: Implements the Selection Sort algorithm to sort the elements in ascending order.

- `PrintArray` function: Prints the elements of the array.

- `main` function: Initializes an array, displays it before sorting, performs Selection Sort, and displays the sorted array.

## Input:

- The program uses a predefined array of integers.

## Output:

- Displays the array before sorting.

- Displays the array after applying Selection Sort.

## Example:

```
Before Sorting 
1 9 5 7 6 3 2 4 10 8 
After Sorting 
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 
```
