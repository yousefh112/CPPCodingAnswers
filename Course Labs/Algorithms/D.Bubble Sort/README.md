# Bubble Sort

This C++ program demonstrates the Bubble Sort algorithm on an array of integers.

## Description

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

## How to Use

1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable.
3. The program will display the array before and after applying the Bubble Sort.

## Code Structure

- `BubbleSort`: Function to perform Bubble Sort on an array.
- `PrintArray`: Function to print the elements of an array.
- `main`: The main function where the array is declared, displayed before sorting, sorted using Bubble Sort, and then displayed again.

## Example

```cpp
Before Sorting
1 25 87 44 12 45 74 84 20 10
After Sorting
1 10 12 20 25 44 45 74 84 87
```
