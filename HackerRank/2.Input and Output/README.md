# HackerRank Input and Output Challenge

## Objective
The objective of this challenge is to practice reading input from the standard input (stdin) and printing output to the standard output (stdout) in C++. It aims to reinforce the understanding of input and output operations in C++.

## Task Description
The task is to read a specific number of integers from the standard input (stdin) and print their sum to the standard output (stdout).

### Input Format
The input comprises a series of space-separated integers provided through the standard input (stdin).

### Output Format
The output is the sum of the integers read from the input, printed to the standard output (stdout).

### Example
For instance, given the input `3 5 6`, the expected output would be `14` (as the sum of 3, 5, and 6 is 14).

## How to Solve
To solve this challenge, you'll need to utilize the input stream (`cin`) to read the integers from the standard input. After reading the numbers, calculate their sum and use the output stream (`cout`) to print the sum to the standard output.
