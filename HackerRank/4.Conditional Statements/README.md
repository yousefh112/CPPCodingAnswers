# C++ Number-to-English-Word Converter

## Task Description
This C++ code snippet serves as a solution for a task that converts an input integer to its English word equivalent if the integer is between 1 and 9, inclusive. If the input integer is outside this range, the program outputs "Greater than 9."

## Code Explanation
The code takes an integer input and checks if it lies between 1 and 9. If the input is within this range, the program converts the integer into its corresponding English word ("one" for 1, "two" for 2, and so on). If the input is outside the specified range, it outputs "Greater than 9".

## Example Input and Output
### Example
For example, if the input is `3`, the output would be:
three

### Input
The program expects an integer input.

### Output
- If the input is between 1 and 9 (inclusive), it outputs the corresponding English word.
- If the input is greater than 9, it outputs "Greater than 9".

## Usage Instructions
- Run the program.
- Input an integer.
- Observe the output, which will be the English word equivalent for inputs between 1 and 9, or "Greater than 9" for inputs outside this range.

Feel free to use this code as a number-to-English-word converter within your C++ projects or learning endeavors.
