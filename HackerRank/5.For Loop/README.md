# C++ Number Range Representation with For Loop

## Problem Description
This C++ code snippet handles the conversion and categorization of a range of integers based on certain conditions. It takes two positive integers separated by a newline and performs specific checks for each integer within that range.

## Input Format
The input expects two positive integers, 'a' and 'b' (1 <= a <= b <= 1000), separated by a newline. These integers define the inclusive interval for the program to process.

### Example Input
An example input might be:
8
11

## Output Format
For each integer 'n' in the inclusive interval [a, b]:

- If 'n' is between 1 and 9, the program prints the lowercase English representation of 'n'. For example, "one" for 1, "two" for 2, and so on.
- If 'n' is greater than 9 and is an even number, the program prints "even".
- If 'n' is less than 9 and is an odd number, the program prints "odd".

### Example Output
Given the example input above, the output would be:
eight
nine
even
odd

## Solution Approach
The code utilizes a 'for' loop to iterate through each integer in the inclusive interval [a, b]. For each 'n', it performs checks as described in the 'Output Format' section and prints the appropriate representation based on the conditions.
