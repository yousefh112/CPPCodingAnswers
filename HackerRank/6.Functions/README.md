# C++ Function: Finding the Greatest of Four Integers

## Problem Description
This C++ code defines a function called `greatest_of_four` that takes four integer inputs and returns the greatest among them. The input includes four integers: 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd', each integer on a separate line. The function determines and returns the greatest value among these four integers.

## Input Format
The input comprises four integers - 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd', with each integer on a separate line.

### Example Input
An example input might be:
4
5
9
2

## Output Format
The program's function `greatest_of_four` automatically handles the input and returns the greatest integer among the four provided. No direct input/output operations are required in the main program.

### Example Output
Given the example input above, the function call would return `9` as the greatest integer.

## Solution Approach
The code defines a function named `greatest_of_four` that compares the four integers and returns the greatest value. This function abstracts the comparison logic, making the program more modular and readable.
