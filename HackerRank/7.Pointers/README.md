# Pointer Update Program

## Overview
This C++ program demonstrates the use of pointers to update the values of two integers based on specific calculations. The `update` function takes two integer pointers as parameters, calculates their sum and absolute difference, and updates the values in memory accordingly.

## Functionality
- The `update` function:
  - Takes two integer pointers (`a` and `b`) as parameters.
  - Calculates the sum and absolute difference of the values pointed to by these pointers.
  - Modifies the values in memory to store the sum in `a` and the absolute difference in `b`.

- The `main` function:
  - Reads two integers (`a` and `b`) from the input.
  - Calls the `update` function with the addresses of `a` and `b`.
  - Prints the updated values of `a` and `b` to the console.

## How to Use
1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable.
3. Enter two integers when prompted.
4. View the updated values of `a` and `b` in the output.

## Example
### Input
```
4
5
```
### Output
```
9
1
```

In this example, the program takes `4` and `5` as input, calculates their sum (`9`) and absolute difference (`1`), and updates the values accordingly.
