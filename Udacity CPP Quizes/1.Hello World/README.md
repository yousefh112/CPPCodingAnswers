# C++ Hello World Program

## Overview
This C++ program outputs the classic "Hello world, I am ready for C++" statement to the console. It serves as a simple introductory example, commonly used to demonstrate the basic structure of a C++ program and the usage of the `std::cout` statement for printing to the standard output.

## Code Explanation
The code is minimal and straightforward. It includes the necessary header file `<iostream>` for input and output operations in C++. The `main` function contains a single statement that uses `std::cout` to print the desired statement to the console.

### Code Sample
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello world, I am ready for C++";
    return 0;
}
