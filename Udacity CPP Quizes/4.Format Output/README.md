# C++ Output Formatting with `<iomanip>` Library and `setw()` Function

## Overview
This C++ program demonstrates the usage of the `<iomanip>` library and the `setw()` function to format output to the console. The goal is to print variables in three columns: Ints, Floats, and Doubles. The program uses the `setw()` function to set the width of each column, aligning the output for better readability.

## Code Explanation
The code begins by declaring and initializing integer (`int`), float (`float`), and double (`double`) variables. It then performs arithmetic operations on these variables and prints them in a formatted table using `setw()` for setting the width of each column. The program showcases two different formatting approaches: using set width (`setw()`) and using tabs (`\t`).

## Usage
This program serves as a practical example of how to use the <iomanip> library and the setw() function to format output in C++. It showcases the alignment of variables in columns for better visual representation
